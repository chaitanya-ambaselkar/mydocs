Respected Sir,

I have been working with your organization in Centre of Excellence department for more than 3 years as a Senior Engineer taking care of business as usual activities and leading and mentor the team.

I think I have spent enough time in the role and division and it is a right time for me to move to the another domain. I would like to expand my realm of work and spend more time working on projects and take up more challenges. In addition, the company is forming a new business unit for DevOps where my skills can be better utilized for the expansion and growth of the business and I would like to switch to this department. I had in the past, taken up trainings on the tools and technologies which are a requirement for being part of the division and I believe I have all the required knowledge and know-how for justifying my move to the new territory. I am sure to come out with flying colours in the new journey.

I hope you will give my request an honest thought and reciprocate positively to the best of your capacity.

Yours Sincerely
