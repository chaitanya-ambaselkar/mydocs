Respected Sir / Madam,

I have recently joined your organization and have been provided a company accommodation as per the company guidelines. However, I am facing certain issues in the guest house and this letter brings out those to you. 

I have been accommodated in the guest house in one of the nearby street overlooking the lake. It is the one bedroom set which has been allotted to me. The lodging provided to me does have a lot of issues which I would like you to look into and solve my concerns.

The living quarter allotted to me was surely used by someone else earlier and it has not been kept. The kitchen is filthy with uncooked and uneaten food lying around, the bedroom is not kept clean, the utensils are not upto the mark and there are a lot of alcohol bottles and cigarette butts lying around.

My request to you is to please look into the concern, and raise the same with the administrative department to get it tidied up since the living area is currently not in a hygienic and liveable state.

Hope, my request will be immediately looked upon. 

Yours Sincerely
