Hey Amit,

I hope you and Neha, both are doing good. I am good too. I am writing you to tell you about a secret party I was thinking of organizing for Anup.

You already know that Anup will be visiting India after a long time and he intends to spend few days with his parents in our home town. Since this will be his first visit to our city post his wedding and he is bringing Monali along and would be her first visit to the city, I was idealizing it would be a good occasion to have  secret party organized for both. I do not yet have a very definitive plan for the gala and do not intend to make to too grand, may be few of our close friends, but was proposing to organize it in some cafe or a restaurant. My intent is to do this ater he has settled down and have spent a few days with his parents. This is just my opinion and I would request your assistance in arranging everything. Let us plan to meet up and aim to discuss and finalize on the agenda and strategy.

I will wait for your call to decide the venue and time for our meeting. Till then, you take care.

Best Regards
