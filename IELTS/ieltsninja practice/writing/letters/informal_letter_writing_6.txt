Dear Mom,

I am doing fine here and hope that you too are doing good. I was thinking of writing to you to let you know more about my hobby class that I am currently taking. Hope you remember about it as I had mentioned it our last telephonic conversation.

You already know how passionate I am about photography and I have taken the love for the hobby from you actually. It runs in our blood. I have in past, had talked to you about my intentions to leave IT profession and take up photography as a full time job. To further pursue my hobby into my profession, I have now joined a well known institute to learn the art of photography and take it forward. 

I have been attending the class for only a few days. Its a weekend course for working professionals like me and most of the other students too are like me. The good thing about the course is that they are going to start off from the basics of the photography like understanding of light, basics of camera, technicals of camera, to the more artistic vision like composition of the image and post-processing. I am as-of-now liking the course and since the instructor is a world famous photographer himself, he knows knacks of the profession very well. 

I think the class would still go on for another couple of months since we are still undergoing theory classes. Post theory, we will have practical outdoor sessions where we would need to shoot the models and since I have taken up wildlife photography, we may even go on some wildlife excursions and safaris. It will surely be a lot of fun and I am actually looking for to it.

That is all I have to write for now, will call you soon. You take good care of your health and do not miss on your medicines.

Love you and miss you!

Your's adorable son.
