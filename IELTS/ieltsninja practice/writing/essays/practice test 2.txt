Technology has aided, to some extent, increase in crime rates. I agree with the statement partially and this essay compares both the sides of the coin and my opinion.

We are surrounded by the technology and gadgets and our lives are full of them. And to say that the technology has become cheap and easily accessible would be an understatement. Technology is everywhere, right from corporate organizations to schools; even our bathrooms are not far from them. 

It is the ease of availability of the access to the technology which makes it almost impossible for the authorities to curb its use. This also makes it easy for the anti socials to get hands on these. One of the most common example of the growing penetration of the technology is availability of mobile phones at rates cheaper than basic amenities of life. It not uncommon to spot young school children using these gadgets nor is it rare to find village men using mobiles and tablets. Apart from this, even the internet accessibility has increased. 

Young kids using these technological gadgets are enslaved by them are sure to use them as they like, making them fall prey to unwanted content like pornography. Data has shown that access to pornography in adolescence in which it is not possible for kids to determine ethical over improper, has given rise to crimes like rapes. The terror attacks in Mumbai were carried out using sophisticated gadgets like satellite phones. Similar was the case in New York twin tower attacks. 

Having said that, it would be inapt to blame technology alone. The responsibility lies with the user and same gadgets when used for something good can benefit entire humankind, for example satellites which predict the weather or storms and save lives.

To conclude,  I would take a partial stand in favour of the statement while blaming the hands which use the it equally as technology itself.
