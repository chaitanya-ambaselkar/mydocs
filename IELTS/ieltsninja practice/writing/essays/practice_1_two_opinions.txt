Few people think that it is justifiable to punish criminals committing serious crimes with death penalty. Whereas, others think it is not virtuous to penalize them with the capital punishment. It is agreed and part of our law system to bring them to justice. This essay first discusses positive elements of punishment by death, secondly the analysis of how execution can be avoided and positive effects of it, followed by the conclusion along with the personal opinion.

We, human  beings, are social animals and are part of larger society. We are also most advanced of the animal species. And hence, the community we live in is based on the rules, regulations and law which we must abide by for a peaceful living. Those who do not follow the rules are sure to be punished, depending on the seriousness of the crime they commit. Some people think that criminals committing heinous crimes should be dealt with death punishment. Any sentence against offender should justify the wrongdoing and should also deter others from committing the same crime. Hence, for crimes as inhumane as murder, judicial execution is the the right sanction.

On the other hand, we as humans are not gods and since we are not too powerful to give life, some others think, we should not take life. Whereas, death sentence could deter some from enacting grave misdeed, it could in fact, increase the gravity of the misconduct. For example, if there was a death penalty for rape and murder a like, accused would more likely kill the victim, for, they have to undergo same judgement for both the crimes. Also, some crimes may be committed in the heat of the moment and accused may not be repeat offender, and such, should get an opportunity to correct and start life afresh.

In my opinion, death warrant should be used only in rarest of rare cases, where the accused has shown no remorse of the misdeed, has been been a frequent lawbreaker and shows no signs of improvement in the character.
