It stands out from the recruitment process that companies are hiring employees with personality are giving more importance to it.

We as human beings, are born with unique and individual personalities. It is one aspect of human character which does not change over time and remains constant. 
Its the individual's personality that makes them unique from others. In addition, personality is something which cannot learnt or acquired. Humans are born with it. 
It is said that only constant thing is change. And true to that spirit, skills keep changing. New graduate hires are first provided with extensive trainings before putting up in projects. 
The reason is, most of the graduate engineer fresh out of college in India are unemployable and do not have the skills required to be productive. However, during the hiring process, aptitude, attitude and analytical abilities are 
tested, which humans either have or don't. This says a lot about how important personality is. Workers keep learning new technologies without which it is almost impossible to grow in their career ladder. And this shows how important role a good personality plays in one's career.

This being said, only good character and personality can't get the work done. The actual jobs are done by the people who have required knowledge and abilities. A good personality would sell products to the market,
however, skills are what make the product. And one would not survive the career without them. Hence in my opinion skills are of much importance.

It would not be wrong to conclude that both skills and personality go hand-in-hand. It would be highly impossible for anyone to succeed without any of the two aspects. One's roles and responsibilities decide which aspect is more important.
